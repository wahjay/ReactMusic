# Shortify

My React Native app that simulates parts of the Spotify mobile app. 

### Player UI.

This player UI is based on https://github.com/aakashns/ReactMusic by Aakash N S.
The playlist is retrieved from my own playlist via Spotify public API. To use the Spotify public API via an App, we need a client ID and a secret key,
which can be easily generated by registering your app via the Spotify dashbord. https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/

Songs that aren't available to play as a preview will be makred with a small red icon on its right end side.
